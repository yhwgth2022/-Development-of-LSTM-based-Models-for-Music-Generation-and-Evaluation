# Development of LSTM based Models for Music Generation and Evaluation

Developed a Critic LSTM model skilled in distinguishing between high-quality and low-quality music. Trained on a diverse dataset comprising expertly composed pieces and subpar music generated randomly, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 75.53% on the test set.
Subsequently created an LSTM-based Composer model, specifically fine-tuned with high-quality music samples for the autonomous generation of "good music."
Utilized the Critic model to conduct a thorough evaluation and scoring of the music produced by the Composer model. This rigorous process yielded an average score of 0.5142842, providing a detailed assessment of the generated music's quality.
